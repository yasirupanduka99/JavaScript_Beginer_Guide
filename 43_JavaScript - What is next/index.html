            After finishing this JavaScript tutorial, you will be able to explore more about JavaScript libraries. You
            can also dive into AJAX and JSON in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>AJAX & JSON</h3>
        <p>
            - AJAX IS ESSENTIALLY A PART OF JAVASCRIPT
            <br />
            - Allows JavaScript to communicate with the server
            without having to leave(or refresing) the web page
            <br />
            - Great example is when you zoom in on Google
            Maps
            <br />
            - JSON is just a way of organizing data & works well
            with AJAX
            <br />
        </p>
        <br />


        <h3>EXPLORING JAVASCRIPT FURTHER</h3>
