    JavaScript HTML DOM
    
        With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.


    The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)

        - When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
        - The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

        With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

            - JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
            - JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
            - JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
            - JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
            - JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
            - JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
            - JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


    What is the DOM?
        The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

        The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

        "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

        The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

            - Core DOM - standard model for all document types
            - XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
            - HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents



    What is the HTML DOM (W3School)?

        The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

            - The HTML elements as objects
            - The properties of all HTML elements
            - The methods to access all HTML elements
            - The events for all HTML elements

        In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

    

    What is the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) (Net Ninja)?

        - The DOM is an 'application programming interface'
        - Use the DOM when we interact with web pages

                + Add content to a HTML document
                + Delete content from a HTML document 
                + Change content on a HTML document

                Note : The document is just the web page

        - Every HTML element in the document is an object:
                + <head></head> is an object
                + <body></body> is an object
                + <ul></ul> is an object
                + <p> is an object
                + etc... (Every tags in HTML document are objects)

        - NODES in HTML
                + Everything we can change in the document is a node:
                    ++ Elements
                    ++ Text within elements
                    ++ HTML attributes

        - What can we do with the DOM?
                + Change the <h1> text node at the top of the page
                + Change the background colour of an element node
                + Animate the logo node from left to right
                + Expand the height of an element node when you click on it
                + PLUS MUCH MORE...
